# udacity_bike_sharing_patterns_proj

I've built my first neural network using NumPy to predict daily bike rental ridership in this project. 
Some of the code was provided by Udacity as part of their Deep Learning Nanodegree, but the implementation of the neural network was up to me. 
After you've submitted this project, feel free to explore the data and the model more.

To reproduce the Bike Sharing project, you'll need to install the requirements on requirements.txt.

Then, execute the notebook  My_first_neural_network.ipynb.
